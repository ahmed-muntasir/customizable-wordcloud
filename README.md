# Word Clouds from Text File
`Word` clouds, also referred to as text clouds or tag clouds, function by visually emphasizing words based on their frequency in a given text source, such as a speech, blog post, or database. The more often a word appears, the larger and bolder it is displayed in the word cloud.

`word_cloud` package was developed by **Andreas Mueller**. You can learn more about the package by following this [link](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud/).

These Two Python scripts developed in Jupyter Notebook make it incredibly easy to generate Word Clouds from text files (.txt) and websites for your everyday text analysis needs. Whether you're preparing for a presentation or compiling a report, these tools offer quick and convenient solutions. As a bonus, they are fully customizable!
